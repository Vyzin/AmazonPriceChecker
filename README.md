# AmazonPriceChecker
A very simple/bad amazon price checker.
Just put your email and password (for your email) in the slots (as well in filling in the other blank slots) or replace the emailing part with however you wanna alert yourself.
(you'll have to create an app password for the program to sign in to your gmail account, heres a link on how to do that if you don't know how: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMjutdwuUQQ and I recommend using an alt email)
